Python Challenges
=================

[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT)

This repository contains challenges for users that wish to learn more about Python 3. It is designed for the users
of the Python community Discord server, but anyone may participate!

Getting Started
---------------

The first thing you should do is [fork this repository](). This will create a copy of the repository under your own
GitHub account. Once you've done this, go ahead and look in the `challenges` folder - each challenge contains a
single file that both has an explanation of the challenge at hand, and a function for you to complete.

You may use any editor you like (including the GitHub web interface) to complete your challenges. When you're ready to
submit your answers for testing, you should [create a pull request](https://github.com/gdude2002/python-challenges/compare).
Once your pull request has been submitted, CircleCI will test your answers and grade them accordingly.

Feel free to continue working on your challenges as long as you want - practise makes perfect! You won't have to create
a new PR every time, so go nuts!

Requirements
------------

Please bear the following things in mind:

* If you're on the Discord server, please include your Discord user ID in the `user.py` file. 
We will notify you on Discord when your grade is available. If you don't know how to find this, see below:
    * Open your [user settings](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/b5r4py1wo69hvit/DiscordCanary_2017-11-16_11-03-51.png) on Discord, 
    [head to the `Appearance` section, and enable `Developer Mode`](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6bygzblcgazwl8f/DiscordCanary_2017-11-16_11-04-28.png).
    * Find yourself in the user list on a server or find a message that you sent, right-click your avatar, and [click `Copy ID`](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/18u6gebweck8066/DiscordCanary_2017-11-16_11-05-25.png).
* Do not modify the tests if you're attempting the challenges.
    * While we don't explicitly check this, if you modify the tests then why bother attempting the challenges in the first place?
* All challenges will be tested for [PEP8 compliance](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
    * We use the excellent [Flake8 tool](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for this.
    * Failing this test will not fail your challenge entirely, but you will lose points.
