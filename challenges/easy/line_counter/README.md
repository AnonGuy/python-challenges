Line Counter
============

**Write a program that takes a filename as a command-line argument and prints the number 
of lines in that file.**

Research Topics
---------------

* `sys.argv`
* `open()`
* `os.path.exists()`
* `os.path.isfile()`

Points
------

* Pass the tests
* PEP8 compliance
* Bonus: Detect missing or invalid filenames and don't error
