Word Count
==========

**Write a program that takes a filename as a command-line argument, counts how many 
times each word appears in the file, and prints the word that appears the most (and 
the number of times it appears).**

Example output
--------------

```batch
> python __init__.py file_with_the_20_times.txt
the: 20
```

Research Topics
---------------
* `sys.argv`
* `for` loops
* `open()`
* `sorted()` and `.sort()`

Points
------

* Pass the tests
* PEP8 compliance
* Bonus: Take a second command-line argument that specifies the number of words and 
counts to be printed. Order the results by the number of times they appear in the file.
